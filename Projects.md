## Stock App <p>
During the winter break of 2020 myself and a peer, Henok Ketsela, had written an app using swift that would allow for the user to create a portfolio. Our idea was to create an app that would allow someone who hasn't really dealt with the stock market to be able to try it out. The person would be given a budget of their choosing and then be able to buy and sell at their choosing.
