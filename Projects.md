# My Projects
## Stock App <a href="https://github.com/Bsully505/StockInformationBSHK"><sub>click here to see.</sub> </a>
During the winter break of 2020 myself and a peer, Henok Ketsela, had written an app using swift that would allow for the user to create a portfolio. Our idea was to create an app that would allow someone who hasn't really dealt with the stock market to be able to try it out. The person would be given a budget of their choosing and then be able to buy and sell at their choosing.

## WaveGame <a href="https://github.com/Bsully505/WaveGame"><sub>click here to see.</sub> </a>
Developed new concepts and enhancements in Java for a level-based arcade game including debug mode for level skipping and modifying scores , “easter eggs” for hidden features, and new game challenges. Worked on a team of four students with two upperclassmen as managers.
